<h3>Taking a snapshot of the etcd db</h3>

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

<h3>Restoring the snapshot in the event of a failure during backup:</h3>

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup \
snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db


Restoring the snapshot in the event of a failure during backup:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup \
snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

Also, remember, to delete the older etcd dir under the /var/lib and rename etcd-from-backup to etcd.

Note: In this case, we are restoring the snapshot to a different directory 
but in the same server where we took the backup (the controlplane node) 
As a result, the only required option for the restore command is the --data-dir.

Next, update the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

We have now restored the etcd snapshot to a new path on the controlplane - /var/lib/etcd-from-backup, 
so, the only change to be made in the YAML file, is to change the hostPath for the volume called etcd-data 
from old directory (/var/lib/etcd) to the new directory (/var/lib/etcd-from-backup).

With this change, /var/lib/etcd on the container points to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup on the controlplane (which is what we want).

When this file is updated, the ETCD pod is automatically re-created as this is a static pod placed under 
the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.

Note 1: As the ETCD pod has changed it will automatically restart, and also kube-controller-manager
and kube-scheduler. 
Wait 1-2 to mins for this pods to restart. 
You can run the command: watch "crictl ps | grep etcd" to see when the ETCD pod is restarted.

Note 2: If the etcd pod is not getting Ready 1/1, 
then restart it by kubectl delete pod -n kube-system etcd-controlplane and wait 1 minute.

Note 3: This is the simplest way to make sure that ETCD uses the restored data after the ETCD pod is recreated. You don't have to change anything else.

If you do change --data-dir to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup in the 
ETCD YAML file, make sure that the volumeMounts for etcd-data is 
updated as well, with the mountPath pointing to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup 
(THIS COMPLETE STEP IS OPTIONAL AND NEED NOT BE DONE FOR COMPLETING THE RESTORE)
