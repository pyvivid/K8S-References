## Understanding SSL TLS Certificates

A certificate is used to guarantee trust between two parties during a transaction.
For example, when a user tries to access a web server, TLS certificates ensure that the communication between the user and the server is encrypted and the server is who it says it is.</br>
There are 2 types of encryption of the data being transferred between a user and the server:
+ 1. Symmetric Encryption = Data and Keys are sent over network and the network sniffer can catch both and decrypt the information. Not a secure method.
  2. Asymmetric Encryption = Uses a set of private and public keys.
