A configMap is an API object used to store non-confidential configuration data in Key: Value Pairs.</br>

A configMap is an API object that lets you store configuration for other objects to use.</br>

A configMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container-images, so that the applications are portable.</br>

When Pods are created, the configMaps can be injected and can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.</br>

Unlike other objects in Kubernetes, configMaps uses “data” rather than “spec”.</br>

configMaps have “data” and “binary” fields.</br>

The name of the configMaps must be a valid DNS subdomain name.</br>

There are 4 different ways, you can you a configMap to configure a container inside a pod:</br>
>> Inside a container command and args</br>
>> Environment variables for a container</br>
>> Add a file in read-only volume for the application to read.</br>
>> Write a code within the Pod that uses the Kubernetes API to read a configMap.</br>
