<h1>Steps for Cluster Upgrades deployed using Kubeadm</h1>

<h3>1. Upgrading the ControlPlane</h3>
A. Drain the node of the pods first and make it unschedulable
	# kubectl drain nodeName --ignore-daemonsets
B. Update the base machine's OS
	# apt-get update -y
C. Update the kubeadm to the latest version
	# apt-get install kubeadm=1.25.0-00
D. Upgrade the Kubernetes Control Node
	# kubeadm upgrade apply v1.25.0
E. Update the Kubelet on the Node
	# apt-get install kubelet=1.25.0-00
F. Reload Daemon and kubelet
	# systemctl daemon-reload
	# systemctl restart kubelet
	Note: Without above step F, the update will still show the older version
	even if the kubernetes is upgraded.
G. Uncordon the Node to ensure, pods are schedulable again.
	# kubectl uncordon controlPlane

<h3>2. Upgrading the Worker Node</h3>

Login to the Node from the controlPlane or as appropriately

A. Drain the node of the pods first and make it unschedulable
	# kubectl drain nodeName --ignore-daemonsets
B. Update the base machine's OS
	# apt-get update -y
C. Update the kubeadm to the latest version
	# apt-get install kubeadm=1.25.0-00
D. Upgrade the Kubernetes Control Node
	# kubeadm upgrade workerNodeName
E. Update the Kubelet on the Node
	# apt-get install kubelet=1.25.0-00
F. Reload Daemon and kubelet
	# systemctl daemon-reload
	# systemctl restart kubelet
	Note: Without above step F, the update will still show the older version
G. Uncordon the Node to ensure, pods are schedulable again.
	# kubectl uncordon workerNodeName
