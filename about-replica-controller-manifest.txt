Replication Controller Vs Replica Set

> Both have the same purpose, but they're not the same.
> Replication Controller is the older technology that is being replaced by Replica Set.
> Replica Set is the new recommended way to set up replication.
> There are minor differences in the way each works 
> The selector is one of the major differences between Replication Controller and Replica Set.
> Say for example, there were pods created before the creation of the 
  Replica Set that match labels specified in the selector, the Replica Set will also take those pods into 
  consideration when creating the replicas.
> The selector is not a required field in case of a Replication Controller but it is still available.
