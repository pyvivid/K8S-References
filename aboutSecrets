By default configMaps, stores variables in clear text format. However, when needed to authenticate to other services that require</br> a password such as the repositories or the docker hub, we will be using passwords/tokens. It is not a good practice to save</br>
sensitive information directly into the pod manifest file and all of this will be visible to anyone with access to the manifests.</br>

Secrets are similar to configMaps, but are specifically intended to hold confidential data such as passwords, token and keys in </br>
an encoded format. They are not encrypted.</br>

Secrets are objects that contain a small amount of sensitive data such as password, a token or a key.</br>

Secrets are by default stored unencrypted in the API serverâ€™s underlying etcd datastore.</br>

Anyone with the API access can retrieve or modify the secret and so can anyone with access to etcd.</br>

Pods can access secrets through:</br>
A files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.</br>
A container environment variable.</br>
A Kubelet, when pulling the images for the pod.</br>
