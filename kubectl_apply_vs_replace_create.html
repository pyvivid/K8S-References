<p>Understanding the differences between&#160;<br>
 kubectl apply<br>
 kubectl create<br>
 kubectl replace<br>
is crucial for managing the Kubernetes resources effectively.</p>

<p>kubectl create is an imperative command that creates a new resource.&#160;However, it fails if the resource already exists.&#160;<br>
kubectl replace is also imperative and replaces the existing resource with a new one. It creates a new resource if it doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>

<p>kubectl apply is a declarative command that manages applications through files defining the resource. It creates the resource if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, and if it does, the resource is automatically updated. This is why kubectl apply is often preferred over kubectl create and kubectl replace as it allows management of resources in a more controlled and predictable manner.</p>

<p>The syntax for kubectl apply is pretty straightforward<br>
# kubectl apply -f FILENAME<br>
e.g. # kubectl apply -f my-app-config.yml</p>

<p>Lets say you want to update the image version within a pod, then we update the manifest file and run the &quot;kubectl apply&quot; to update the images in realtime.</p>
